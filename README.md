#MuraGoogleCalendar

This is a [Mura CMS](http://getmura.com) plugin that displays events from a public Google Calendar. This plugin leverages the [FullCalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/) [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin. This allows for a much easier way for front and back end developers to visually customize the calendar as opposed to using Google's embed code.

##Tested With
* Mura CMS Core Version 6.0+
* Adobe ColdFusion 10.0.10
* Railo 4.0.4
